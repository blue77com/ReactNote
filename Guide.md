To launch the project, open the command line in the folder containing the docker-compose.yml file and run the command docker-compose up.  

After that, the application will be available at http://localhost:2626/.  

If you have made changes to the list of comics, added new books, chapters, or images, it is recommended to use the command docker-compose up --build to rebuild the project and apply all the changes.
